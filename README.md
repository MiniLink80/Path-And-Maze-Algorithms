# Random-maze-generation

This is a visualizer for two maze generation algorithms. Namely, Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm coupled with a grid of randomly weighted edges, and a random depth first search of a grid.
These two algorithms are based on a graph with a rectangular grid of vertices and edges connecting adjacent vertices.
